    C64  -  BASIC  10  LINER  CONTEST  -  PUR80  
    
    READY.
    
**Autobang!** is an **old-school home computer game** for **Commodore 64 BASIC v2**. I developed this (very average) gameplay back in my C64 days ('80-something) as my first complete game project: after more than 30 (!!!) years, I come to re-implement it as a 10-liner for the **"BASIC 10 Liner Contest 2021"** ( https://gkanold.wixsite.com/homeputerium/rules2021 ).

Although it features a very common and "naive" gameplay, I aimed to obtain the best graphics, sound and UI I could squeeze in 800 chars, and the most possibly fun and challenging.

Its name is a tribute both to:
 - *"Autobahn"* (masterpiece album by Kraftwerk, German band universally recognized as pioneer in electronic music, made by analog synthesizers: definitely not that far from the Commodore SID chip sound style!)
 - a toy car (*"AUTOBANG"*) I owned in my childhood (ie: near-C64 era), named like that for it featured support for a toy gun tiny explosive charge, which was triggered by a bumper on its nose, thus blowing up with a "bang!" when sent against a wall.

### Story & gameplay
You are **Bangy Boy**, a brave driver in a **car with no brakes**, running like crazy in a winding country road and trying to stay alive while **following the road** turns and **avoiding pines** grown in the middle of the road (?!?).

Your goal is to **complete the whole track 10 times** (*stages*), but it won't be that easy: at every new stage (greeted by a start banner with the stage # on it) the road gets a bit narrower and you will find more and **more trees** on your way.

The **game ends** when you **hit road borders / a tree**, or if you **complete the race**.

Score increases while you proceed in your crazy run, depending on the current stage (higher levels => more points).

***Your sporty car can turn fast.. will your reflexes and strategy be as good, enough to bring you to the end of the run?***

### Instructions to play the game
- Open WinVice (C64)
- Select *"File"* -> *"Autostart disk image..."*
- Attach "autobang.prg" file

### In-game controls
**Z** = Move left

**M** = Move right

### Attract mode commands
**"Q"** = Quit

*Any other string* = Start a new race

###  Technical notes
Along with the game itself, the code features a **tiny attract screen** (shown between a game and the next), **explaining the commands**, while allowing (quit command) to **exit the program gracefully**, ending up with no killer sounds going on (phewww!).

The **game main loop** works by **PRINTing the road** through **semi-graphic lines** at the **bottom of the screen**, thus triggering **system scroll routine** (you can also "take a rest" keeping Ctrl down if you wish! But you won't be able to turn meanwhile, so no big plus..), while **drawing trees** at random positions through **video RAM POKEs**.
This allows to create **trees of 2 chars** while still scrolling 1 line at a time. 
The max number of trees per line is a random number from 1 to current level/2, and are randomically positioned.
They can appear out of the road too. This is done not only for aesthetic purposes, but also to provide more difficulty balance. 

The **car is rendered with VIC sprite #0**, initialized in code as a long vertical "stick" 6 pixels wide, partially hidden in its highest part to look more like a car than a bus :-)
It can move in steps of 8 pixels every printed row, so it's capable of 45Â° turns. 

**Track DATA** are structured in **sectors**, represented by **int pairs** (format: *`[turn direction X], [sector length Y)], ....`*). Due to the C64 BASIC default array size (10 elements), track sectors are limited to a number of 10.
Track width is initially 21 chars, and then it's reduced by 1 char every new level. 

All **sound effects** are handled by **SID voice #1**, initialized once and then reprogrammed on-the-fly between sawtooth (engine infinite sound while racing) and noise (crash) waveform when needed.

The game ends up with a **"GAME OVER"** (crash sound) or a **"GOAL!"** message (whistle sound), along with the final score.
Sounds duration and sprite initializations (run every time on purpose) give enough time to the player to read his score before the attract screen comes back in.

The **game code works best on R3 KERNALs** (ie: with video color RAM fix), although **it is compatible with all older C=64** versions too, at the expense of a small glitch (ie: trees trunks are white on R1, and invisible on R2. Tree crowns colouring is instead available on any version). Out of this graphic glitch, the game is totally playable on any real or emulated C64 machine.

#### Code stats + "fun facts"
The program is made of 10 lines (0-9), for a total of 793 actual code chars + 6 "cosmetic" chars.
You will read **my initials ("DRP") at the end of lines 3-6**. While "D" and "P" comes from actual code chars, "R" (**line 5**) comes instead from a syntax error-ed short block of code (never parsed, so unharmful), featuring **a smilie :-)** too.

#### Variables

**All variable names are 1 char long** to save space. **S** and **V** are used to access **SID** and **VIC II** registers with shorter code (like it used to be in the good ol' days). **D** and **P** are used to sign the code with my initials too.

**C** = Car position (x)
**E** = scorE
**D** = # of track sector Data (zero-based)
**L** = current Level
**N** = curreNt track sector
**O** = track row Offset (x)
**P** = temP iterator for trees and game over graph&sound effects
**Q** = Quick temp variable to gain some bytes
**R** = current sector Row
**S** = SID first register location
**T** = Track current position (x)
**V** = VIC II first register location
**W** = track Width (recalculated at every row)
**X**(array) = track sector turn delta X (0=go straight; <0 = turn left; >0 = turn right)
**Y**(array) = track sector length Y

**K\$** = pressed Key (in game) / chosen command (attract mode)
**R\$** = game Result
